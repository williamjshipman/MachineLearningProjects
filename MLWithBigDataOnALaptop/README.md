# Machine learning with big data on a laptop

This is the source code for my presentation "Machine learning with big data on a laptop, or an SSD is all you need" as well as some additional examples. These demos centre around the Tennessee Eastman process fault detection dataset, which is inconveniently large, although technically it will fit in memory on any computer with at least 8GiB RAM.
